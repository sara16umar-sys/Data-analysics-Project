1.Data Analytics Bootcamp Project
Analyzing Google Play Store App Trends using Python & Power BI.
Tools Used:Python,Google colab,Power BI
This project focuses on performing an end to end data analysis of the Google Play Store dataset.
The goal was to understand app trends such as popularity,rating,and pricing and to visualize insights through Python and Power BI
DAY - 01
On the first day,We focused on preparing the dataset for analysis:-
a)Imported the Google Play Store dataset from Kaggle using Google Colab.
b)Explored dataset structure using .info() and .describe().
c)Converted data types where necessary and filtered invalid entries,handled missing data,removed duplicates.
d)Saved the cleaned dataset as
cleaned_playstore.csv.
I have learned how to use Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing
Handling inconsistent or missing values and preparing clean dataset for analysis.
DAY - 02
The second day focused on exploring and understanding data patterns using visualizations.
a)Loaded the cleaned dataset into colab.
b)Explored app categories and distributions,visualized app rating using bar plots,histograms and scatter plots.
c)Performed correlation analysis between Rating,Install,Reviews,Price.
d)Derived insights like which category are most popular and which have higher ratings.
I have learned how to create effective visualizations and understand relationship and trends.
DAY - 03
The final day was about bringing everything together visually in Power BI.
a)Uploaded the cleaned dataset to Power BI.
b)Created interactive dashboard with following visuals:
 Bar chart:Top 10 category by count
 Donut chart:Free vs Paid app distribution
 Line chart:Average rating by category
 Cards:Average rating and total installs
 I have learned how to use Power BI dashboards creation and data storytelling,designing dashboards that highlight actonable business insights.
